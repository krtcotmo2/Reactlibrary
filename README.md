If the Heroku server is asleep it may take a few moments for the default data to load.

Basic exercise with React and MongoDB building on previous knowledge of API calls using Axios. The page loads by querying the Google Books API searching for the NY Times Best Seller list. From here, React takes the json data returned and builds cards for each book. At the same time, the application reaches out to the Mongo DB and pulls all the items saved in the “my favorites” collection. This pull allows the cards to show the add to or remove from favorites buttons accordingly when any search is made.

The top navigation allows the user to toggle between any search and favorites saved.

## How it was built
[<img src="https://github.com/krtcotmo2/Reactlibrary/blob/master/client/public/library.png"/>](https://react-myreading-library.herokuapp.com/)

The componentDidMount function uses the google books api to get results using the terms Best Sellers list to get top current books. The system then goes to the Mongo db and gets the users saved books. I preform some mapping of the two lists to find their intersection points and if there is a common book, that book is flagged to have the "Add to favorites" button switch to "Remove from favorites." 

The user has the ability to enter in a keyword value, a topic, an author, a title, etc. to perform a search. The results are returned in a list of book objects.

React breaks down that list and displays them with a series of cards. The isbn number is stored as the key value for each book. The add/remove button uses that isbn number to store/remove from the Mongo db.

The Mongo db requires that the isbn be a unique value so that no duplicates can occur.

```
Model:

{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5cb1cac7a907d6002a6fad11"),
    "author" : "Kyle Mills",
    "title" : "Smoke Screen",
    "isbn" : "0786260505",
    "synopsis" : "Through a series of unwanted promotions, Trevor Barnett has become the lead spokesman for the tobacco industry just as it's on the verge of extinction.",
    "image" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=koQXyaN1pdwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api",
    "link" : "http://books.google.com/books?id=koQXyaN1pdwC&dq=smokescreen&hl=&source=gbs_api",
    "pageCount" : 568,
    "date" : ISODate("2019-04-13T11:40:55.619Z"),
    "__v" : 0
}

```

To reproduce the repository locally you will need to establish a new storage in your local machine. If you are not using Mongo you will also need to modify the models and the controllers. Regardless of your storage type, you will need to adjust the connection as well. The line I have for connecting to the db is in the server.js file, line 28. Adjust accordingly. 
```
// Connect to the Mongo DB
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI || "mongodb://localhost/reactreadinglist");

```
Install the node packages by using your installer (yarn, npm, etc.) and start up the services.
```
npm install
npm run start
```
